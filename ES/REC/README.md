## REC - recreation potential

Recreation potential (RP) provided by ecosystems was mapped based on the ESTIMAP geomatic model (European Commission, 2013). based on several landscape characteristics: degree of naturalness of land-use categories (DN), natural protected areas (NP), water components (W). DN was based on a land-use map with categories attributed a naturalness score as in Appendix 1.2. NP was assessed based on protected areas of Switzerland, from the TLM_PA item of swissTLMRegio database (Swisstopo, 2020). W was assessed by computing inverse relative distance to lake coasts, getting the highest value at lake coast and a decreasing value for 2km. Final RP indicator is a normalized aggregate (sum) of the three landscape characteristics maps.
