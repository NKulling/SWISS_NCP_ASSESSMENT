## MED - medicinal plants

This service is mapped based on potential spatial distribution of 380 medicinal plants in the landscape. A list of main medicinal plants is created based on studies from Dal Cero et al. (2014) and Rey et al. (2023) (available [here](https://github.com/NKulling/SWISS_ES_ASSESSMENT/blob/main/ES/MED/list_sp.csv)). We modelled the probability of distribution of each of these species and aggregated the prediction maps to get the mean habitat suitability value for plant species. 

R script used to generate the ES map is available in this repository. It required heavy computing capacities and was run in HPC environment using provided shell script.
