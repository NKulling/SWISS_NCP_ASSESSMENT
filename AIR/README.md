## AIR- Removal of PM10 by vegetation

Particulate matter (PM) is a well-known health risk when concentrated in large quantities, especially in cities, and its removal is a widely used indicator for the ES of air quality regulation. Vegetation (especially trees) can filtrate airborne pollutants such as PM by capturing them on their leaves and trunk, and the pollutants getting washed off by precipitations. To map the PM10 removal potential of vegetation, we used remote-sensing data (Leaf-Area Index) coupled with a land-use map and the dominant leaf type of forests, as well as a digital elevation model (DEM). Pollutants deposition rate (table below) per leaf area surface and land-use type are retrieved from the literature (Remme et al., 2014). Formula of PM10 removal was adapted from Nowak et al. (2006) based on Braun et al. (2018). 

The map generated is the potential of pm10 removal. the actual removal of PM10 will depend on its concentration in the air. 

| Vegetation type                                        | Dry deposition rate |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Coniferous forest                                      | 0.008               |
| Broadleaf forest                                       | 0.003               |
| Heath, peatland, grassland, cropland and  other nature | 0.001               |
| Water, urban and infrastructure                        | 0                   |
