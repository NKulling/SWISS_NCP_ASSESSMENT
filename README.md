This repository contains the scripts, tables, and parameters utilized for generating 15 Nature's Contribution to People (NCP) indicators and 1 biodiversity indicator map. These maps are the outcomes of the ValPar.CH project.

## Overview

The repository is organized into two main folders:

- **NCP Folder:** Contains detailed scripts and tables related to Nature's Contribution to People.
- **BD Folder:** Includes scripts and parameters for the biodiversity indicator, composed of a prioritization of species distribution models (SDMs).


## Map Display

Feel free to explore the folders to access specific scripts, tables, and parameters used in the generation of these indicators.
