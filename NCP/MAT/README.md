## MAT - wood provision potential

In Switzerland, wood is the second source of renewable energy after hydropower. The potential supply of wood-based energy is based on annual forests growth. To map this growth, we use annual forest growth from the Swiss greenhouse gas inventory (table 6-15, FOEN, 2020). Values are in m3 per hectare and are multiplied by 0.625 to get a value per pixel. Switzerland is then divided in altitude and production regions (similarly to CAR – Carbon storage), and the corresponding value of gain in biomass (table A15) is attributed to each cell of a land-use map that corresponds to "productive forest" (table 1). Areas with a slope superior to 110% not considered in the analysis as they are considered not suitable for wood harvesting (Dupire et al., 2015).
